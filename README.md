Small full-stack MERN app for a simple shopping-list, with basic functionalities of adding / editing / deleting list of items. I am using Mongo, React, Redux, reactstrap (for dealing with bootstrap) and Express at the backend.

This app has been bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

To run this app:

* Clone this repo
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run build`
* Run `npm start`
